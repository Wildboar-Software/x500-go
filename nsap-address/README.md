# NSAP Address Encoding, Decoding, and Printing in Go

This is a library for encoding, decoding, and printing NSAP addresses written
in pure Go. Network Service Access Point (NSAP) addresses are defined in
ITU-T Recommendation X.213.

This is primarily used in X.500 directories, but it might also be used by X.400
Message Handling Systems (MHS).
